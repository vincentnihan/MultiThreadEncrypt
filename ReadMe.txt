The program take the plaintext as input and output ciphertext or take ciphertext as input then output plaintext. The encryption algorithm is using Caesar Cipher technique which simply replace letter with letter. The program will create multiple threads to read the plaintext, multiple threads to encrypt or decrypt, multiple threads to output the result onto the output text. Mutual exclusion technique was applied in order to ensure synchronization between threads.
